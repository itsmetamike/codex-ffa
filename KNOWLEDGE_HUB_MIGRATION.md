# Knowledge Hub Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully extracted document ingestion from the multistep workflow and created a standalone "Knowledge Hub" module that can be accessed by multiple agentic workflows.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Knowledge Hub Page
**Created:** `/src/app/knowledge-hub/page.tsx`
- Standalone document management interface
- Upload documents with metadata (brand, doc type, title, effective date)
- View all uploaded files for a brand
- Delete individual files or all files for a brand
- Modern UI with improved visual design
- Direct link back to home page

### 2. New API Routes
**Created:** `/src/app/api/knowledge-hub/` namespace
- `upload/route.ts` - Upload documents to vector store
- `list/route.ts` - List all documents for a brand
- `delete/route.ts` - Delete individual document
- `delete-brand/route.ts` - Delete all documents for a brand

All routes mirror the functionality of the old `/api/vectorstore/` endpoints but are now namespaced under Knowledge Hub.

### 3. Updated Workflow Steps
**Modified:** `/src/components/StepIndicator.tsx`
- Removed "Document Ingestion" from workflow steps
- Updated step routes: removed `/ingest`, starts with `/context`
- Updated step names to reflect new 5-step workflow
- Changed default totalSteps from 6 to 5

**New Workflow Steps:**
1. Context Builder (was step 2, now step 1)
2. Brief Parsing (was step 3, now step 2)
3. Workflow Orchestration (was step 4, now step 3)
4. Pre-Research Consultation (was step 5, now step 4)
5. Deep Research (was step 6, now step 5)

### 4. Updated Page References
**Modified:** All workflow pages to reflect new step numbering
- `/src/app/context/page.tsx` - Step 1 (was 2)
- `/src/app/brief/page.tsx` - Step 2 (was 3)
- `/src/app/workflow/page.tsx` - Step 3 (was 4)
- `/src/app/results/page.tsx` - Step 4 (was 5)
- `/src/app/deep-research/page.tsx` - Step 5 (was 6)

### 5. Updated Home Page Navigation
**Modified:** `/src/app/page.tsx`
- Added "Knowledge Hub" to navigation links
- Added "Context Builder" to navigation links
- Removed "Ingest Documents" from navigation
- Updated session start/continue to go to `/context` instead of `/ingest`
- Updated homepage description to emphasize Knowledge Hub as centralized module

### 6. Updated API References
**Modified:** `/src/app/context/page.tsx`
- Changed `/api/vectorstore/list` to `/api/knowledge-hub/list`
- Updated error messages to reference "Knowledge Hub" instead of "/ingest"

## Architecture Benefits

### Centralized Knowledge Repository
The Knowledge Hub now serves as a standalone module that:
- Can be accessed independently of any workflow
- Stores brand intelligence in one place
- Can be leveraged by multiple agentic workflows
- Provides a single source of truth for document management

### Cleaner Workflow Separation
- Document management is no longer part of the linear workflow
- Users can manage documents at any time without disrupting workflow progress
- Workflows can reference the Knowledge Hub when needed
- Better separation of concerns

### Scalability
- Easy to add new workflows that tap into the Knowledge Hub
- Knowledge Hub can be enhanced independently
- API namespace allows for future expansion

## Files to Note

### Old Files (Still Present, Can Be Deprecated)
- `/src/app/ingest/page.tsx` - Old document ingestion page
- `/src/app/api/vectorstore/*` - Old API routes (still functional but deprecated)

### New Files
- `/src/app/knowledge-hub/page.tsx` - New standalone Knowledge Hub
- `/src/app/api/knowledge-hub/*` - New API namespace

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Remove Old Files:** Consider removing `/src/app/ingest/` and `/src/app/api/vectorstore/` after testing
2. **Add Knowledge Hub Link:** Consider adding a prominent link to Knowledge Hub in the main navigation header
3. **Documentation:** Update user documentation to reflect new Knowledge Hub workflow
4. **Testing:** Test all workflows to ensure they properly access the Knowledge Hub APIs

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload documents via Knowledge Hub
- [ ] View uploaded documents in Knowledge Hub
- [ ] Delete individual documents
- [ ] Delete all documents for a brand
- [ ] Build context pack from Knowledge Hub documents
- [ ] Navigate through all 5 workflow steps
- [ ] Verify step indicators show correct step numbers
- [ ] Verify home page navigation works correctly
