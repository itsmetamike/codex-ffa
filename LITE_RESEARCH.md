### What Lite Research Doesn't Do

‚ùå **No web search** - Uses only provided context

‚ùå **No file search** - Doesn't access vector stores
‚ùå **Single strategy** - Not multiple options
‚ùå **Less depth** - Focused, not comprehensive
‚ùå **No background mode** - Must complete in one call

### Workarounds

**Need web research?**
- Use Full Deep Research instead
- Or manually research and add to consultation chat

**Need multiple strategies?**
- Run Lite Research multiple times with different focus
- Or use Full Deep Research

**Need data analysis?**
- Provide data in consultation chat
- Or use Full Deep Research with code interpreter

## Best Practices

### 1. Provide Good Context

Lite Research relies on your input. Make sure to:
- Complete the consultation chat thoroughly
- Be specific about objectives
- Include key insights
- Mention constraints

### 2. Use for Iteration

Lite Research is perfect for:
- Testing different angles quickly
- Refining your approach
- Getting quick validation
- Budget-conscious exploration

### 3. Upgrade When Needed

Start with Lite, upgrade to Full when:
- You've validated the direction
- You need comprehensive analysis
- Budget allows
- Stakes are high

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No response from model"

**Cause**: API error or timeout

**Solution**: Try again, check API key

### Issue: "Model returned invalid JSON"

**Cause**: Model didn't follow schema

**Solution**: This is rare with gpt-4o-mini's JSON mode. Try again.

### Issue: Results seem generic

**Cause**: Insufficient context provided

**Solution**: 
- Add more detail in consultation chat
- Be specific about brand voice
- Include more constraints
- Or use Full Deep Research for web-researched insights

### Issue: Missing sources

**Cause**: Lite Research doesn't do web search

**Solution**:
- Sources are based on provided context only
- For real citations, use Full Deep Research
- Or manually add sources to consultation
