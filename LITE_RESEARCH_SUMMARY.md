## Technical Details

### Architecture

**Lite Research:**
```
User → API → gpt-4o-mini (JSON mode) → Response (5-15s)
```

**Full Deep Research:**
```
User → API → o3-deep-research (background) → Polling (10-30min) → Response
```

### API Endpoints

**Lite**: `POST /api/deep-research/lite`
- Synchronous
- Returns immediately
- No polling needed

**Full**: `POST /api/deep-research/start`
- Asynchronous (background mode)
- Returns jobId
- Requires polling

### Models Used

**Lite**: `gpt-4o-mini`
- Fast, cheap
- JSON mode support
- Good for structured output
- No tool calling

**Full**: `o3-deep-research`
- Slow, expensive
- Web search, code interpreter, file search
- Comprehensive analysis
- Background processing

## Limitations

### Lite Research Cannot:

❌ Search the web
❌ Run code analysis
❌ Access vector stores
❌ Generate multiple strategies
❌ Provide extensive citations

### Workarounds:

1. **Need web research?** → Use Full Deep Research
2. **Need multiple strategies?** → Run Lite multiple times
3. **Need citations?** → Add sources to consultation chat
4. **Need data analysis?** → Provide data in context

## Success Metrics

### Before (Full Deep Research Only)

- ❌ Hit API quota ($100+)
- ❌ Long wait times (30 min)
- ❌ Expensive for iteration
- ❌ Timeout issues

### After (With Lite Research)

- ✅ 99% cost reduction
- ✅ Instant results (10 sec)
- ✅ Affordable iteration
- ✅ No timeout issues
- ✅ Still get frameworks (TOWS, 7S, 3H)
