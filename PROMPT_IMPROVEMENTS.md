# Prompt Improvements - Preventing Truncation

## Problem Identified

The Lite Research output was being truncated or abbreviated, resulting in:
- Short TOWS explanations (1 sentence instead of 2-3)
- Minimal core mechanic descriptions
- Limited source citations (6 instead of 10-15)
- Generic language without specific examples

## Root Cause

The original prompt lacked explicit instructions about:
1. **Minimum token targets** - No clear expectation for output length
2. **Anti-truncation directives** - No explicit "DO NOT TRUNCATE" instructions
3. **Field-level requirements** - No specific length requirements per field
4. **Quality standards** - Vague guidance on comprehensiveness

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Explicit Anti-Truncation Instructions

**Added to Output Contract:**
```
- **DO NOT TRUNCATE**: Provide complete, detailed explanations for each field
- **DO NOT SUMMARIZE**: Give full context and reasoning, not abbreviated versions
- **Be thorough**: Each TOWS move should be 2-3 sentences with specific examples
- **Be comprehensive**: Each field should contain substantive content, not placeholder text
```

### 2. Increased Token Targets

**Before:**
- Target: 2,000-3,000 tokens
- Vague: "Keep it concise"

**After:**
- Minimum: 2,500 tokens
- Target: 3,500-4,000 tokens
- Directive: "Aim for the higher end"
- Quality Standard: "AVOID brevity - comprehensive is better than concise"

### 3. Field-Level Requirements

**Added specific requirements for each field:**

**Core Mechanic:**
- "2-3 paragraphs minimum for core_mechanic"

**TOWS Analysis:**
- "SO Move: 2-3 sentences with specific data points and examples"
- "ST Move: 2-3 sentences with specific data points and examples"

**McKinsey 7S:**
- "shared_values should be 2-3 sentences explaining alignment"

**Three Horizons:**
- "rationale should be 2-3 sentences with specific justification"

**Placements:**
- "5-10 channel/placement combinations"

**Sources:**
- "aim for 10-15 sources minimum" (up from implied 6-8)

### 4. Critical Output Requirements Section

**Added 8-point checklist:**
1. **COMPLETE all fields** - do not leave any field with minimal content
2. **EXPAND on insights** - provide 2-3 sentences minimum for strategic elements
3. **INCLUDE 10-15 sources** - demonstrate thorough research
4. **PROVIDE specific examples** - name brands, campaigns, case studies
5. **CITE data points** - include percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes
6. **EXPLAIN rationale** - don't just state conclusions, show reasoning
7. **AVOID brevity** - comprehensive is better than concise for this output
8. **USE full sentences** - not bullet points or fragments in prose fields

### 5. Output Quality Standards Section

**Added at end of prompt:**
```
## Output Quality Standards:
- MINIMUM 2,500 tokens, TARGET 3,500-4,000 tokens
- Each strategic field (TOWS, 7S, 3H) should have substantive, detailed content
- DO NOT use abbreviated language or truncate explanations
- PROVIDE full context and reasoning for every strategic decision
- INCLUDE specific brand names, campaign examples, and case studies where relevant
- CITE data with inline references (e.g., "77% of consumers prefer X ([source.com](url))")
```

### 6. Final Reinforcement

**Added at very end:**
```
IMPORTANT: Aim for comprehensive, detailed output. Do not truncate or abbreviate.
```

## Expected Impact

### Token Count Increase
**Before:** ~1,900 tokens (your last run)
**After:** 3,500-4,000 tokens (target)
**Increase:** ~85-110% more content

### Cost Impact
**Before:** ~$1.00 per run
**After:** ~$1.50-2.50 per run
**Still:** 95-97% cheaper than Full Deep Research ($50-100)

### Quality Improvements

**TOWS Analysis:**
- Before: "Leverage strengths to capture opportunities"
- After: "Leverage PlayNova's certified STEM learning focus and eco-friendly design (brand strengths) to capture the fast-growing educational toy market, which grew 15% YoY in 2024 according to NPD Group. For example, emphasize sustainability credentials in social campaigns targeting eco-conscious parents, who represent 58% of the target demographic and show 23% higher purchase intent for certified eco-friendly products."

**Core Mechanic:**
- Before: 1 paragraph, ~50 words
- After: 2-3 paragraphs, ~150-200 words with specific examples

**Sources:**
- Before: 6-8 sources
- After: 10-15 sources with diverse types (industry reports, case studies, academic research)

**McKinsey 7S:**
- Before: "Creativity, learning, family togetherness"
- After: "Creativity, inclusivity, learning and family togetherness form the core shared values, consistent with research showing that cooperative play fosters creativity and cognitive development in children aged 6-10. This aligns with PlayNova's brand positioning as an educational mentor and supports the strategy's emphasis on co-creation experiences."

## Comparison: Before vs After

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Token Count** | 1,900 | 3,500-4,000 | +84-110% |
| **TOWS Length** | 1 sentence each | 2-3 sentences each | +100-200% |
| **Core Mechanic** | 1 paragraph | 2-3 paragraphs | +100-200% |
| **Sources** | 6-8 | 10-15 | +25-87% |
| **Specificity** | Generic | Specific examples | Qualitative |
| **Data Points** | Few | Many (%, $, timeframes) | Qualitative |
| **Cost** | ~$1.00 | ~$1.50-2.50 | +50-150% |

## Why This Works

### 1. **Explicit is Better Than Implicit**
Models respond better to explicit instructions like "DO NOT TRUNCATE" than implied expectations.

### 2. **Quantified Targets**
"2-3 sentences" is clearer than "be thorough"
"3,500-4,000 tokens" is clearer than "comprehensive"

### 3. **Repetition Reinforces**
Multiple mentions of anti-truncation throughout the prompt (system, contract, task, final) ensure the model prioritizes completeness.

### 4. **Examples Guide Output**
Showing citation format `([source.com](url))` ensures consistent formatting.

### 5. **Checklist Creates Accountability**
8-point checklist gives the model clear success criteria to verify against.

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Same Input, Compare Output
Run the same PlayNova brief and compare:
- Token count
- TOWS sentence count
- Number of sources
- Presence of specific examples

### Test 2: Edge Cases
Test with:
- Minimal context (does it still expand?)
- Complex brief (does it handle depth?)
- Multiple constraints (does it balance?)

### Test 3: Cost Validation
Track actual costs:
- Input tokens
- Output tokens
- Web search calls
- Total cost per run

## Rollback Plan

If costs exceed $3-4 per run consistently:

**Option 1: Reduce Token Target**
- Change from 3,500-4,000 to 2,500-3,000
- Keep anti-truncation directives

**Option 2: Conditional Depth**
- Add "If budget allows, expand to 4,000 tokens"
- Otherwise target 2,500 tokens

**Option 3: Field Prioritization**
- Mark critical fields for expansion
- Allow brevity in less critical fields

## Summary

- 10-15 credible sources (vs 6-8)
- 2-3 sentence explanations (vs 1 sentence)
- Specific examples and case studies
- Still 95-97% cheaper than Full Deep Research

**Cost Impact:**
- ~$1.50-2.50 per run (vs $1.00 before)
- Still well within your $3 target
- Still 95-97% cheaper than Full Deep ($50-100)

The prompt is now optimized to prevent truncation while staying cost-effective! ðŸŽ‰
