# How to Validate Deep Research is Actually Running

## Method 1: Check OpenAI Dashboard (Best Proof)

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. Look for recent API calls to "Responses API"
3. Check token usage - should be increasing
4. Check cost - deep research is expensive ($$$)

**What you'll see:**
- Model: `o3-deep-research-2025-06-26`
- Tokens: Thousands (10k-50k+)
- Cost: $5-$50+ depending on complexity
- Status: Running or Completed

## Method 2: Query the Database

```bash
pnpm prisma studio
```

Then:
1. Open `DeepResearchJob` table
2. Find your job (most recent entry)
3. Check fields:
   - `responseId`: Should match OpenAI response ID
   - `status`: Should be 'queued' or 'in_progress'
   - `prompt`: Your full research prompt
   - `startedAt`: Recent timestamp

## Method 3: Call OpenAI API Directly

Use the response ID from your logs:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses/resp_083889b7ef7c9e9f0068f6e0f3fa3c8196ab98959207990966 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "id": "resp_...",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "model": "o3-deep-research-2025-06-26",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "output": [...],
  ...
}
```

## Method 4: Check Your Status Endpoint

```bash
# Get your jobId from the database first
curl http://localhost:3000/api/deep-research/status?jobId=YOUR_JOB_ID
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "in_progress",
  "result": null,
  "error": null,
  "toolCalls": null
}
```

## Method 5: Monitor Network Activity

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "status"
4. Should see requests every 5 seconds to `/api/deep-research/status`
5. Check response - status should progress from `queued` ‚Üí `in_progress`

## Method 6: Check Server Logs

In your terminal where `pnpm dev` is running, you should see:

```
[Deep Research] Starting with model: o3-deep-research
[Deep Research] Prompt length: 22800
[Deep Research] Response created: { id: 'resp_...', status: 'queued', ... }
```

Then periodically:
```
prisma:query SELECT ... FROM DeepResearchJob WHERE id = ?
```

## Method 7: Wait for Status Change

The most definitive proof is when status changes:

**Timeline:**
- **0-30 seconds**: `queued` ‚Üí `in_progress`
- **10-30 minutes**: `in_progress` ‚Üí `completed`

When it changes to `in_progress`, you know OpenAI is actively processing.

## Method 8: Check for Tool Calls (When Complete)

Once completed, the response will include:
- `output` array with tool calls
- `web_search_call` entries (20-50+)
- `code_interpreter_call` entries (5-15+)
- `message` with final report

## Signs It's REALLY Working

‚úÖ **Response ID exists** (starts with `resp_`)
‚úÖ **Status is 'queued' or 'in_progress'** (not 'failed')
‚úÖ **OpenAI dashboard shows usage**
‚úÖ **Cost is accumulating**
‚úÖ **Status endpoint returns valid data**
‚úÖ **Network requests every 5 seconds**
‚úÖ **Database has job record**

## Signs It's NOT Working

‚ùå Status immediately shows 'failed'
‚ùå No response ID in logs
‚ùå OpenAI dashboard shows no usage
‚ùå Status endpoint returns "Job not found"
‚ùå No network requests in DevTools
‚ùå No cost accumulating

## Your Current Status

Based on your screenshot:
- ‚úÖ **"Research Queued"** - Good!
- ‚úÖ **Purple progress section** - UI working!
- ‚úÖ **Response ID in logs** - Job created!
- ‚úÖ **Status: 'queued'** - OpenAI accepted it!

**Verdict: IT'S REAL! üéâ**

## What Happens Next

1. **Within 30 seconds**: Status changes to `in_progress`
2. **Every 5 seconds**: UI polls for updates
3. **10-30 minutes**: Research completes
4. **Completion**: Full report appears with:
   - Research activity log (all tool calls)
   - Comprehensive report (2,000-10,000 words)
   - Inline citations (10-50+ sources)
   - Structured strategies with frameworks

## Cost Estimate

Deep research is expensive:
- **Input tokens**: ~20k-30k (your prompt)
- **Output tokens**: ~10k-50k (research + report)
- **Tool calls**: 20-100+ (web searches, code runs)
- **Total cost**: $10-$100+ depending on complexity

Check your OpenAI dashboard to see actual cost.

## How to Be 100% Sure

Run this command with your actual response ID:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses/resp_083889b7ef7c9e9f0068f6e0f3fa3c8196ab98959207990966 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

If it returns valid JSON with `"status": "in_progress"`, it's definitely real!

## Alternative: Check in OpenAI Playground

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/playground
2. Click "Responses" tab
3. Look for your response ID
4. Should show status and progress

## Bottom Line

Your implementation is working! The proof:
1. ‚úÖ Response ID generated
2. ‚úÖ Status is 'queued'
3. ‚úÖ UI showing progress
4. ‚úÖ Polling active

**It's real. Just wait for the results!** ‚è≥
